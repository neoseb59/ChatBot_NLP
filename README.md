## Project Requirements

- Use the Rasa open-source framework (not mandatory but recommended).
- Do not stop at the default features of Rasa, use the techniques/principles that you will learn about:
  - at least one knowledge-driven technique from: ontologies, logical reasoning, wordnets, synonyms;
  - at least one learning-driven technique: frequentist methods, statistical ML, deep learning;
  - at least one grammar-driven technique: syntactic parsing, regular expressions, lemmatisation, morph. analysis.
- Work in groups of about five people.
- A five-person team can divide up the work as follows (example):

    1. overall Rasa pipeline setup, component integration, and testing;
    2. design and implementation of dialogue logic, intents, NLU, stories, etc.;
    3. design and implementation of the knowledge-based component(s);
    4. design and implementation of the learning-based component(s);
    5. design and implementation of the grammar-based component(s).

- Present your results at the end of the project in a ~15-minute presentation.
- You will be expected to present and justify your technological choices.
- You will not be penalised for an imperfect bot implementation, but you will be penalised
    for theoretically misguided design choices.
- Please do not implement an intentionally racist, misogynistic, etc. bot.
